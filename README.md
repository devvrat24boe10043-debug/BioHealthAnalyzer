# BioHealth Analyzer - Medical Data Management System

## Overview
A Java-based console application for managing patient data and analyzing medical vital signs, developed for bioengineering healthcare applications.

## Implementation Approach
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Structured using Java OOP principles with separate classes for each functionality
- **Modular Architecture**: Five interconnected Java classes handling specific responsibilities
- **File-Based Persistence**: Custom file management system for data storage and retrieval
- **Medical Standards Integration**: Health analysis based on clinical medical thresholds

## Features
- Patient registration and management
- Medical data recording (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature)
- Automated health risk analysis
- File-based data persistence
- Interactive console menu system

## Technology Stack
- Java 17
- File I/O Operations
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (ArrayList, HashMap)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Git (for cloning repository)

### Installation & Execution
1. **Clone repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devvrat24boe10043-debug/BioHealthAnalyzer.git

2. Navigate to project directory:
   cd BioHealthAnalyzer

3. Compile Java files:
   javac src/*.java

4. Run application:
   java src/Main

**Code Details & Architecture**
Class Structure:
Main.java: Entry point with menu-driven interface

Patient.java: Patient data model with personal information

MedicalRecord.java: Medical measurements storage

HealthAnalyzer.java: Health risk analysis algorithms

FileManager.java: File I/O operations for data persistence

Key Algorithms:
Blood pressure classification (Hypotension/Normal/Hypertension)

Heart rate evaluation (Bradycardia/Normal/Tachycardia)

Temperature assessment (Hypothermia/Normal/Fever)

Data Storage:
CSV-style file format for patient records

Automatic data loading on startup

Persistent storage on application exit

Usage Guide:
Launch application using above instructions

Follow menu prompts to:

Add new patients (Option 1)

View existing patients (Option 2)
